<h4>Svalbard</h4>
<p>Metal and glass glinted under bright white light. They bore it as they had borne it for thousands of years: with elegant austerity. The hall they formed spanned perhaps fourty meters squared, with round walls rising in cathedralic heights. It was far higher than wide; altogether, it resembled an egg with a flattened bottom. A wall spanned the middle of the floor, one and a half meters tall, with a half a meter wide surface lavished with technology. Above the metal, a thin transparent layer implemented subtle lights. They react to touch, conveying meaningless information, long-since divorced from its cultural context.</p>
<p>The wall divided the hall as it divided its two occupants. On the side far from the entrance was a humanoid, made from complex flesh clothing a thin, calcified inner structure. His hands polished a glass in a gesture that was carefully calculated to seem absent-minded. Opposite him, on the wall's other side, lay ten tons of rough plates of volcanic stone, connected by another ton of organic material. Its surface was insectile, yet too massive. The segmented body suggested a cross between an ant and a slug. In its wake, the steel floor was dented, but repairs would be trivial. The guest's mind, while capable of abstract, complex thought, contained no ego. There was no guest, in a very real sense, only a collection of biological systems and mental objects. Such states of being were common in this part of the universe.</p>
<p>"The reservation was quite sudden," the host said, careful not to directly adress the guest. "I fear I might have to improvise."</p>
<p>"No matter," the guest answered. Its voice was synthetic, engineered to feel fitting for the giant. It gravelled, evoking boulders grinding each other to dust. "It is said that no disappointing meal has ever been served here."</p>
<p>"It is true, and I take pride in it." The host put the glass down and made a gesture. Behind him, steel walls parted, revealing glass-clad shelves reaching above his head, barely within reach of his arms. The shelves held plant parts, harvested at the precise perfect moment and kept in perfect storage. They held animals, some entire and some dismembered, preserved without dryness, salt or cold. Beyond that, the shelves held oils and essences; powders and minerals; liquids fermented, distilled, and concentrated, some holding floating contents.</p>
<p>To the guest, every part of this was alien. It knew no plants, no animals in the true sense, no fungi. Its sense of "life" contained only the sentient, and all its customary nutrients derived from inanimate sources. Precious little of what was on the shelves even seemed edible to it.</p>
<p>The host knew. He retrieved what seemed like small, round rocks from the shelves, a thick clear liquid and a number of pastes and powders. "This house keeps no menu. There is no Ã  la carte, no set course. Instead, I employ an ever-changing theme. In recent times, it has been based on a simple, ancient rhyme: 'Something borrowed, something blue, something old and something new.'"</p>
<p>The guest had no eyes, but its technological augmentations allowed it to see nonetheless. It looked at the rocks, and was confused, as they did not look anything like the rough igneous stones it was used to. The liquid, at least, was somewhat like the mountain milk it was used to, that prized and expensive nutrient of its home. Yet it was too clear, too thin, did not emanate the vapours it should. It was of bad quality.</p>
<p>"We begin with something borrowed. It is, of course, immediately evident that none of these ingredients come from any planet close to here. In this sense, they are borrowed. In another, I will borrow concepts from something more familiar."</p>
<p>The guest watched with great interest as the host cracked the rocks. They were but thin, calcified shells over another clear, thick liquid with orange spheres floating within. With practiced movements, the host cracked ten of them in a metal bowl, fished the spheres out with careful fingers, and let them drop into a high and narrow clear cylindrical container. He added drops of a sharp-smelling liquid, and a tiny bit of a yellow paste. Finally, he opened a metal tin with a black, crystalline powder inside, and the guest was enraptured. It was black perfection, the powdered concentrate of all that made eating more than mere sustenance. It was unlike everything the guest had ever seen, yet so immediately, obviously, the greatest thing it would ever ingest.</p>
<p>The host inserted a cylindrical metal tool into the container. Then, he topped up the container with clear liquid.</p>
<p>"This antique was once called a blender. Usually, I would prefer more technologically advanced means, but in this case, the old approach yields a comparable result, and serves as 'something borrowed'. Please excuse the noise."</p>
<p>With the push of a button, the blender sprang into whirring action. Where its blades passed through the mixture, clear liquids combined to form an opaque emulsion. The result was beige and viscous, sloughing off the blender in rich curtains. Without embellishments, the host presented the container.</p>
<p>The guest shivered. Stone plates shifted, distending the organic material connecting them. In the sinewy red matter, a hole opened. It protruded, forming a proboscis almost half a meter long. That organ descended into the container, sucking it dry within seconds.</p>
<p>"Most... delicious," the guest said with some hesitation.</p>
<p>"I chose a recipe that emulated familiar eating habits. Though I must say I am surprised that it was taken to so readily." Even after decades in this sector, the host sometimes struggled with the contortions of language required to not address the guest directly. "Is it not known since ancient times that the natural is preferred over the artificial?"</p>
<p>"It is true," the guest said, forcing out the answer.</p>
<p>"Is it not further known that the only nutrient approved for eating is secreted by the planet itself, rendering every other form of sustenance sacrilege?"</p>
<p>"It is true," the guest said, the synthetic voice indignant. "This food was derived from rocks, was it not?"</p>
<p>"What seemed to be rocks are called eggs, calcified nutrient packages containing the offspring of a living thing. Its organic material has not experienced the cleansing heat and pressure of the planet."</p>
<p>"Sacrilege," the guest whispered, stricken.</p>
<p>"Yet here is a mind that was prepared for it," the host said, adressing the guest by parts. "A moral core that has accepted the consequences. All to taste my cooking, despite hailing from a society that has no <em>concept</em> of cooking."</p>
<p>"Do not speak of society," the guest said. "It is an aggression that will not go unanswered."</p>
<p>The host inclined his head slightly. "Regardless, a reservation was made, and a meal will be served. On the <em>Svalbard</em>, hospitality is an ironclad principle. There will be three more courses, if the meal is to be continued."</p>
<p>There was a long silence in which only the grinding of stone plates on flesh was heard. The guest broke it in a miniscule voice. "Please."</p>
<p>Over the etched metal surface dividing them, the host held an outstretched hand. Beneath his palm, the air shimmered. A distortion spread, rose with the host's hand, and a complicated machine appeared. It measured half a meter in every direction. On its quadratic metal base, talons of various exotic materials were arranged in concentric circles. All pointed inwards, as if clutching the central airspace. They bore pipes and cables, miniscule chips of silicon and other tiny components.</p>
<p>"Please excuse this tool's inelegant appearance. It is a personal project, tailor-made for this one application. It will assist me in creating something blue."</p>
<p>The tool awoke with a deep, reverberating hum. Carefully, the host poured a few drops of an orange liquid into its center. They formed a sphere there, unaffected by gravity, slowly rotating. What followed was an act of high-technology alchemy. Over the next ten minutes, the host added a plentitude of liquids, powders, even gases to the sphere, adding layer after layer around it. It fizzed, boiled, hissed with reactions. Some were stilled immediately, others kept working, their sounds layering over each other in a quiet postmodern symphony. Finaly, the host scooped out the sphere in a solid metal tumbler, and there it floated, slowly turning on its axis. Its surface was blue, streaked with tiny clouds of white condensate, a planet in miniature.</p>
<p>"Please enjoy," the host said.</p>
<p>"It is not liquid." There was deep scepticism in the guest's artificial voice.</p>
<p>"It will serve. Or is this not considered desirable?"</p>
<p>"Careful," the guest gravelled. "Some jokes are not universally appreciated." Nevertheless, it extended its proboscis. After a probing motion, it sucked at the sphere. Instead of being swallowed in its entirety, the sphere sloughed off layers. First, the gasses and blue liquid covering; then, the bedrock lying underneath fractured, exposing the molten orange core. Finally, even that was gone.</p>
<p>"A complex morsel. Combinations of temperatures, textures, states of being that this mind never considered. Consuming a planet... symbolic, yet deliciously literal. Perhaps even approved, as long as it is sterile."</p>
<p>The host gave a tiny bow. "I assure that all hints of ecosystems were mere culinary fiction."</p>
<p>"Careful," the guest growled.</p>
<p>"Why obfuscate? I know what brings this visit. I know what the <em>Svalbard</em> harbours. What it was meant for, before I reappropriated it."</p>
<p>The guest spoke as if in answer. "A long-distance ship. From the outside, a worn and pitted asteroid, yet that is merely an abrasive shell to protect against high-velocity debris. Beneath the rock is metal, a so-called perfect archive of a far-away planet's treasures. An ecosystem sampled and filed away."</p>
<p>"More than far away," the host said, his voice casual. "The planet no longer exists, and these samples are the last ones of many of these species. As am I, or so I assume. What more natural choice for a custodian?"</p>
<p>"You," the guest said, spitting out the word, "are not manifold. A pitiful singularity, consumed by the illusion of one-ness. There is nothing <em>natural</em> about an organism that has forgotten it is but a sum of its organs, a planet-born that no longer participates in its native system. Disgusting. Claiming to be a custodian while hawking away that which they are sworn to protect in a perversion of what is natural. Hacking off parts of a planet to sell to the highest bidder."</p>
<p>"Let me change that mindset," the host said. "I proceed to the third course, something old."</p>
<p>He retrieved a decorative glass tube of a thick, sludgy black liquid. "This is ancient," he said. "On the planet it came from, the cleansing processes of heat and pressure that purify organic matter take millions upon millions of years. It is exotic, yet traditional, pure and allowed matter, but from a forbidden source."</p>
<p>He poured it into a glass, then continued. "Of course, this is not truly oil from that planet, though it is modelled on an original sample. Merely a matter-duplication trick. In origin, it is a part of another planet; in being, it is like any other synthetic ration produced on a spaceship. What philosophy governs this nutrient? Moderates and traditionalists disagree. Philosophy is abstract, measured. Yet that proboscis twitches in anticipation. The mind could refuse this course as it could have refused any other. The charade of making a reservation to eat was merely necessary to enter the <em>Svalbard</em>, not to remain on it. The digestive tract has other plans."</p>
<p>The guest ate.</p>
<p>The host continued. "And now there is something else. There are taste receptors, even in this species which has not conceived of food as art. They serve to inform the mind whether a nutrient has gone bad, according to the traditionalist explanation. Heretics proclaim that some foods taste better than the oils of the planet, better than its crystalline growths.</p>
<p>"<em>Flesh</em>," the host said, drawing out the word as the guest shuddered. "Despite the mind's indoctrination, despite culturally ingrained disgust, the taste receptors are heretics. And even one who has never strayed from the right path sees the difference between the first course and the third. The victory of the artificial over the natural, of dead flesh over the planet's sacred oils."</p>
<p>"You," the guest said, still slurping. "You do not shake me. The mind does not waver. The body lives and grows. The stone is still hard and unyielding."</p>
<p>"At odds," the host said. "Listen to the body's shaking. Let it reach the mind. Live in harmony."</p>
<p>"You are a heretic. An alien deceiver. Sacred rules reverberate within me. These excesses do not stain. They are excused, for they are means to a holy end. This alien desecration of life, this cruel parade of corpses, needs to end."</p>
<p>"That body cannot act. Those stone plates cannot move forward to kill me." The host was cleaning up in preparation. "There is a final course. Something new."</p>
<p>In silence, he retrieved a long cylinder with knobbed ends. It was almost as long as the host's arm, and twice as thick. For the most part, its surface was smooth and white, though some parts were stained crimson.</p>
<p>"Another fake stone," the guest said.</p>
<p>"True. Like the egg, it is a calcified part of a once-living body. A part of that body's internal support structure, to be more precise. At least, that is the sort of meal this would be in general, but in this particular case, the bone has been grown in laboratory conditions. It corresponds to no species that has ever lived; it is completely, utterly new."</p>
<p>"Another philosophical quandary," the guest scoffed.</p>
<p>The host moved his hand along the bone, and it scorched and blistered. Application of heat was a function that his kitchen abstracted away from any device. When the bone had been heated this way, the host broke it clean through and offered it to the guest.</p>
<p>"This is something new," the guest said. "A poisoned gift, like all the others. The mind will not shake. The stone is unyielding."</p>
<p>"And the body consumes," the host said. "I am not so arrogant as to assume that I could change the world on my own. No, the purpose of the <em>Svalbard</em> is to plant a seed. To illuminate possibilities to the guests, and gently guide them to consider that other paths are possible."</p>
<p>"The body is not tainted," the guest said, slurping. "It has been granted an exemption from dogma. No seeds have taken root."</p>
<p>"That is yet to be seen. Regardless, this has been pleasing."</p>
<p>"It is not over. The <em>Svalbard</em> will be taken from the hand of the thief. It is well-documented that you are not the legitimate owner."</p>
<p>"True," the guest said. "I stole it. However, the original owners are long dead, and I am the most legitimate claimant."</p>
<p>"The law is grey in this area," the guest said, its voice taking on a threatening tone. "What if the most legitimate claimant dies as well?" Twelve tons of rock and one ton of organic material stood on one side of the flimsy wall, and less than a hundred kilograms of soft flesh on the other. Yet the host did not flinch.</p>
<p>"Murder is not a grey area. There is great suffering on that path."</p>
<p>"The mind can accept suffering. Rise beyond it, overcome that burden, if it is borne for a sacred purpose."</p>
<p>"Mere talk," the host said. "Words are empty of action when wielded by a powerless mind. The body does not move, does it? The stone does not rise to crush me."</p>
<p>Silence settled over the hall as the host cleaned up. When he was done, he spoke. "The meal has come to an end, and other guests are waiting. Leave."</p>
<p>And the guest left.</p>
